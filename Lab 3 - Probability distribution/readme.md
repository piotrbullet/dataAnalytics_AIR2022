# Lab 3 -  Probability distribution



## Excercise 1 - Divergence problem
```stan1.stan```

The aim of exercise is to observe appearance of divergence problem in case of specific geometry of probabilistic density space. Check the behavior for 1 and more samples. Make your conclusions based on results.

## Excercise 2 - Binominial example
```stan2.stan```

Using binomial model fit the theta parameter to the data. 

## Excercise 3 - Predictive checks

- Check the posterior predictive distribution with experimental data distribution. (model: stan3)
- Check the model comparing model prior distribution with experimental data distribution and formulate conclusion. (model: stan4)
- Plot your own histogram for prior example to better visualise the result
